linux-webcam-stream: Simple Linux webcam streaming
**************************************************


linux-webcam-stream is a simple program that provides live webcam
streaming for Linux machines via Apple's wonderful HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)
mechanism.

Please note that this is a small side-project for me that is just getting off
the ground. Check back often for new updates and features. And of course, feel
free to contribute.

Also, as a derivative work of video4linux, x264, and GPL-enabled ffmpeg ,
all source code in this directory also exists under the GPL license. Please take
note of this if you decide to use or integrate this software.
